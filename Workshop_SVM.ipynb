    "If the dataset is linearly separable, there are infinitely many hyperplanes that can be used to separate the data. However, we want to have the best hyperplane such that it is robust to variations in test or new data. For example in the below figure, the left panel desribes two possible lines that can be used to classify the data. However the blue boundary line is prefered because it can still correctly classify the data even if there is small variation in new data points. The right figure describes the `margins` (dotted lines) which is the shortest distance between any data points to the boundary line. SVM tries to find the hyperplane that can maximise this margin. All the points that lie on these two pairs of margin lines are called `support vectors`.\n",
